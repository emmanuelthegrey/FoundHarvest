# FoundHarvest

An MVP for an app designed to automate the food donation process of Local Detroit Nonprofit Forgotten Harvest. This app was written in primarily in Java using Spring MVC. We worked with Forgotten Harvest to understand their needs, and built our pipeline around that. Forgotten Harvest agreed to incorporate this into their actual website.
